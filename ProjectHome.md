# Webtastic #

Webtastic is a app, that shows the best sites, optimized for you device. Something like a bookmarker on your PC webbrowser, PlayStation® Portable or your Apple® iPod Touch, iPhone or iPad.


The sites are different for each device. Because the PSP™ has less browser memory than the iPhone has. That is a big difference. And all the sites are used are copyrighted. Also in each version the PC version always has more apps!
